# Get a Grep!

Here is Bram Stoker's book Dracula, in its entirety, in a text file (it's in the public domain, woohoo!). Your task is to use the `grep` (and perhaps some of your own quick googling skills) to accomplish the following:

### **All from the terminal!**

------

### 1. Find out what chapter the following line is in:

### `the train from Varna to Galatz`

(HINT: This is part of the first sentence of its chapter)

------

###  2. Find out the chapter number that comes soon after this line:

### `she fell forward in a faint`

(HINT: This is part of the last sentence of the chapter it's in)

------

### 3. Who wrote this entry, and what date was it written?

### `some horrible doom hanging over us`

**BONUS**: search the string and include the whole journal entry in the result, with one command. There are a few ways to do this...
