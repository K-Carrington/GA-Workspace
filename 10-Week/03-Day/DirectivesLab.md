# Directives Lab

We've learned how to use custom directives to yield a partial template file. Now it's time to apply this to create a full view using templates invoked by custom directives. Your view should use templates for a header (with a navigation bar), a body,  and a footer.

Populate your Angular controller with some data (users, posts, candies, kitties, sports cars, whatever you like), and have them display in your body template.

You can use any front-end CSS library you wish, including [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/), [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/), etc.

## Bonus!

Use custom filters to manipulate how you display this data in your view.
